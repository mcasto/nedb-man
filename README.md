# nedb-man

nedb-man is a (very) thin wrapper around nedb-promises, which, of course, is a thin wrapper around nedb.

I wrote this for a specific use case where I wanted easy access to the list of my stores without having to manually build a separate array to track them.

Obviously, it requires [nedb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) and [nedb-promises](https://github.com/bajankristof/nedb-promises).

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install nedb-man.

```bash
npm i mcasto/nedb-man
```

```bash
yarn add mcasto/nedb-man
```

## Usage
